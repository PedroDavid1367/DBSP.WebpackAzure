The\r\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\r\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\r\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n      Terminology\r\n      -----------\r\n\r\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\r\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\r\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\r\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\r\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\r\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\r\n\r\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\r\n\r\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\r\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\r\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\r\n\r\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\r\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\r\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\r\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\r\n      itself fulfill.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Basic Usage:\r\n      ------------\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n        // on success\r\n        resolve(value);\r\n\r\n        // on failure\r\n        reject(reason);\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      promise.then(function(value) {\r\n        // on fulfillment\r\n      }, function(reason) {\r\n        // on rejection\r\n      });\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n      Advanced Usage:\r\n      ---------------\r\n\r\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\r\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      function getJSON(url) {\r\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\r\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n\r\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\r\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\r\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\r\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\r\n          xhr.send();\r\n\r\n          function handler() {\r\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\r\n              if (this.status === 200) {\r\n                resolve(this.response);\r\n              } else {\r\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          };\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\r\n        // on fulfillment\r\n      }, function(reason) {\r\n        // on rejection\r\n      });\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      Promise.all([\r\n        getJSON('/posts'),\r\n        getJSON('/comments')\r\n      ]).then(function(values){\r\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\r\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\r\n\r\n        return values;\r\n      });\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n      @class Promise\r\n      @param {function} resolver\r\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\r\n      Useful for tooling.\r\n      @constructor\r\n    */\r\n    function $$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver, label) {\r\n      this._id = $$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\r\n      this._label = label;\r\n      this._state = undefined;\r\n      this._result = undefined;\r\n      this._subscribers = [];\r\n\r\n      if ($$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\r\n        if (!$$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\r\n          $$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (!(this instanceof $$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\r\n          $$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        $$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    $$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = $$promise$all$$default;\r\n    $$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = $$promise$race$$default;\r\n    $$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = $$promise$resolve$$default;\r\n    $$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = $$promise$reject$$default;\r\n\r\n    $$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\r\n      constructor: $$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\r\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\r\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      findUser().then(function(user){\r\n        // user is available\r\n      }, function(reason){\r\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\r\n      });\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n      Chaining\r\n      --------\r\n\r\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

findUser().then(function (user) {\r\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\r\n      }).then(function (comments) {\r\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\r\n
